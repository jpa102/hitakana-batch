hi, welcome!

basic introduction:

	the name "hitakana" is basically hiragana and katakana fused into one word (i know it's
	silly, but that's the "term" i've thought while developing this script)

	this script returns hex data for japanese kanas, also gives functional links for google and youtube
	when you paste them into the browser's address bar, it will be rendered as a normal character
	ex: https://google.com/search?q=%e3%82%8a to https://google.com/search?q=り



in this text file, i'll be explaining some info about the files and folders:

	<folders>
	"addons" folder - where user-created scripts are placed
			i've included a script named "basicwords.bat" that includes some common japanese words
			after you've placed the scripts inside, launch them by typing addons\yourscript.bat (in some cases, it may be in .cmd format)

	"data" folder - this is where "database.pdb" is located, loaded by another script named "_launcher.bat"

	"utils" folder - where utilities are located, mostly for main.cmd. do not touch them, really.

	<files>
	\addons\build.txt - where you can read about how to make your own script
	\data\raw_database.txt - where you can see all of the hex data for the japanese kanas
	about.bat - prints out the about texts in the command line
	doc.txt - this document / text file that you're reading right now
	main.cmd - the main "executable"
	main.ini - configuration file for main.cmd, nothing really special
	PrintHelp.bat - a script that supplies you with help and information about how to use this
	uninstall.cmd - self-explanatory
