you may have noticed that in database.html, there's a line that references **jsConsole.js**

this file comes from windows 11, mainly in "C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\js" which you can get right now

to use this, simply get the file and press the following keys: ctrl (left) + shift (left) + j, this will bring up a console overlay

the console log command is different here. you don't have to type console.log(), you can just type in log()
