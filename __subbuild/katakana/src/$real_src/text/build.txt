build.txt

this is the addons folder, where you can add other's scripts and run them
but if you want to create your own script, here's what to do:



first things first, these are the functions that you can use: (i'm not gonna list all of them though)

	cd /d "%~dp0" - this will change directory to the same path the script is being executed on
	cls - clear the console's screen
	echo - print out the specified text on screen
	:: or rem - these are used for comments, they are ignored / do nothing
	:YourLabel - this is the label, you can give it any name that you can think of
	goto YourLabel - go to a specified label
	call - call a batch script or executable (call myscript.bat | call myexecutable.exe)
	start - this will start a new instance of the command line (start myscript.bat | start myexecutable.exe)
	cmd /k - start an instance without closing the command line

	set MyVariable=contents - define a new variable, it can be anything
	|
	if your variable contains spaces, you can set it like this:
		set "MyVariable=This variable has spaces!"
	note that the variable ITSELF cannot have spaces, the contents of the variable will not matter

	if else - conditional
	|
	example:
		IF exist filename.txt (
			echo the file "filename.txt" exists.
		) ELSE (
			echo the file "filename.txt" does not exist.
		)

	%errorlevel% - the error code being given after execution (0 - successful, 1 and up - not successful? / something went wrong?)
	|
	you can test this out by typing echo %errorlevel%


	more information by typing cmd /?



now for the fun part, creating your script. this is mainly for adding custom japanese words / characters but you can create whatever you want
you can use this example:

==========================

@echo off

set hazukashii=%__%e6%__%81%__%a5%__%e3%__%81%__%9a%__%e3%__%81%__%8b%__%e3%__%81%__%97%__%e3%__%81%__%84

==========================

	(this will give hex data for the word "hazukashii")

 	note that %__% is the variable for the percentage character (you can open basicwords.bat in notepad for more examples of these)

 	keep in mind, this data does not come from the default data\database.pdb, i got this from google translate ("embarrassed" word)
	you can create your own database for your hex data if you want, but you can use the default database to define your own words
	
	to get your own data, you will need to turn this:
		https://www.google.com/search?q=恥ずかしい&oq=恥ずかしい&aqs=chrome..69i57.1280j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
	to this:
		https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%81%A5%E3%81%9A%E3%81%8B%E3%81%97%E3%81%84&oq=%E6%81%A5%E3%81%9A%E3%81%8B%E3%81%97%E3%81%84&aqs=chrome..69i57.1280j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
	by copying the entire url from the address bar and pasting it into notepad

	you will only want to get the part that looks like this:
		%E6%81%A5%E3%81%9A%E3%81%8B%E3%81%97%E3%81%84 (do you notice the difference?)

	now. when you have the raw hex data, you need to process this by pressing left ctrl and h
	type in the find what: %
	and then type in the replace with: %__%
	press replace all and you're done!

	once you got it processed, you can then set it as a variable:

	set hazukashii=%__%e6%__%81%__%a5%__%e3%__%81%__%9a%__%e3%__%81%__%8b%__%e3%__%81%__%97%__%e3%__%81%__%84

save it, and you're all done!
you have just created your own script!
