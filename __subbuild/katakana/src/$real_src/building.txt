By launching makefiles.cmd script, you are building the files for this script
Once you've built the files, you can then compile them all
into an exe installer using iexpress (see build.cmd)

The build files will be located at src folder
You can choose to move the build files to your own directory for personal use
Running the $cleanup.cmd script will delete them all


NOTE:
	You MUST replace the "YourDriveDirectory" in hitakanabatch_setup.txt
	with YOUR own directory path (do not change the hitakana_batch\src as it will break)
	After that, rename the file extension .txt to .sed

	You can change the author name in build.ini, it's optional

	If they request for the source code where you've built the exe installer,
	you must provide it to them UNTAMPERED
	Structure: hitakana_src[yourname].zip (it can be in any archive format)

Happy building!
