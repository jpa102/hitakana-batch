You need to replace YourDriveDirectory with your path in hitakanabatch_setup.txt
Example:

	Find what: YourDriveDirectory
	Replace with: C:\buildproject

You can do this by pressing ctrl + h in notepad (or other text editor)
Don't include the hitakana_build\src in the path!

This is crucial because the IExpress will fail if
it can't find the proper directory location

Once you're done, rename hitakanabatch_setup.txt to hitakanabatch_setup.sed
If you have "show file extensions" disabled, you can still do it in the
command line by running this command:

	ren hitakanabatch_setup.txt hitakanabatch_setup.sed
	
	(the command line should be run in the current
	directory, you can do this by typing in cmd.exe in the file explorer address bar)

And you should be good to go
