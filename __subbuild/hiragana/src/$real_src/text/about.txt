echo 	This script will let you get japanese characters in hex form.
echo 	Just type in the key letter variable and it will give you the
echo 	hex data for that character for you to copy ^/ paste into the browser!
echo.
echo 	%__%e3%__%81%__%8b%__%e3%__%81%__%a3%__%e3%__%81%__%93%__%e3%__%81%__%84%__%e3%__%81%__%84 for kakkoii ^(hiragana^)
echo 	--- This will go after https://google.com/search?q=
echo.
echo 	Alternatively. Type in s/ in the address bar and paste your hex in there, then
echo 	press the tab key to get the hiragana / katakana that you want

echo ======================================================================================

echo 	Originally, i created this mainly for fun :D XD XP
echo. 	I wasn't aware that characters outside of latin alphabet
echo 	can be turned into hex after copying a link from the browser
echo 	address bar and then pasting it into the standard notepad.exe
echo 	I would always wonder why they look like this after doing that.
echo.
echo 	Now that i've been used to using computers for longer periods
echo 	of time, i eventually discovered why that happens. And because
echo 	of that, it gave me the motivation to create this script.
echo.
echo 	In the early development, i had no idea how to store the hex
echo 	data with the percentage %__% character in a variable, so i
echo 	resorted to storing them in a text file for now.
echo 	The script would parse the text horribly ^(text scattered
echo 	everywhere in the console screen^) so i gave myself a break,
echo 	leaving behind the script for months.
echo 	After some research and watching my favorite youtuber "@endermanch"
echo 	for hours, it made me rewrite my script from the ground up, adding
echo 	features and more characters as i research the japanese alphabet
echo 	and its characters in the Internet.
echo.
echo 	From there, i learned how to set up a settings file for use
echo 	in the main script, generating a new settings file in case it
echo 	was deleted accidentally, and how to call another script without
echo 	starting it up in a separate window.
echo.
echo 	There are characters that i found interesting, take %__%e3%__%82%__%90
echo 	for example.
echo 	This is one of the characters i accidentally discovered after
echo 	messing around with the hex values in the address bar. It is
echo 	the ^/wi^/ character in japanese hiragana. Also including %__%e3%__%82%__%91
echo 	which is ^/we^/. This character %__%e3%__%82%__%8a is the first
echo 	character that i've easily memorized in hex form, i originally
echo 	discovered this while i was inspecting some exe file 
echo 	from a hex editor and i thought it's a cool looking character.
echo.
echo 	I also memorized %__%e5%__%8f%__%a4, %__%e8%__%a6%__%8b, %__%e3%__%81%__%95, and %__%e3%__%82%__%93
echo 	which when combined is spelled "komisan", the two hex are in
echo 	japanese kanji. I have no idea how i was able to memorize all
echo 	of them despite looking complex to an average person.
echo.
echo 	By the end of september, this script is pretty much complete and
echo 	in a usable state. I was feeling proud of what i've created and
echo 	since then, i found myself searching in google using japanese
echo 	characters. I even found content that i now like and content that
echo 	other people talk about, like anime for example.
echo 	It would trigger the correction mechanism from google search since
echo 	i was searching it in a different way.
echo.
echo.
echo.
echo 	This is about it. I'm happy if you've made it this far and actually
echo 	read this long essay of mine :D It definitely took me a lot of time.
echo.
