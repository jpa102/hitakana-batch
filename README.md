# introduction
this is hitakana, a silly *batch script* that **outputs** japanese kana (hiragana & katakana) in utf-8 hex that's formatted to be pasted into any web browser (address bar)

## building
go to src/$real_src and run makefiles.cmd
this will combine all the text files into batch scripts (where main.cmd is the main batch script)

## usage

## why is it named like that?
i combined (hira)gana and kata(kana) into "one" word, that's why it's spelled like that
